# non-recursive_quick_sort_in_c
## Overview

This project is a C implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm using a non-recursive approach.
To achieve the non-recursiveness, a stack data structure is also implemented and utilized to manage the sub-array boundaries during the sorting process.

## Features
- Non-recursive implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm
- Custom stack data structure to handle sub-array boundaries
- Efficient sorting of integer arrays
